# Teacher Portal

## Project Overview
The Teacher Portal is a simple, scalable web application built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides teachers with a user-friendly interface to manage student records, including adding, updating, and deleting students, as well as viewing student lists.

This project includes:
- User registration and login functionalities.
- A home dashboard for teachers to view and manage student records.
- Student management features including adding, editing, and deleting records.
- Inline editing using JavaScript for a seamless user experience.

## Features
1. **User Registration**: Allows teachers to register for an account.
2. **Login**: Teachers can securely log in with their credentials.
3. **Student Dashboard**: After login, teachers access a list of students with the ability to add, edit, or delete entries.
4. **Add New Student**: Teachers can add a new student entry using a form. The app checks if the student with the same name and subject exists; if so, it updates the existing entry by adding the new marks.
5. **Edit & Delete Student**: Teachers can edit or delete student records directly from the list.
6. **Logout**: A secure logout option that ends the session.
